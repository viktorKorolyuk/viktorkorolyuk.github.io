        <h1>Who I am:</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Viktor Korolyuk and I am a mobile and web developer and a visionary, I look for new technology and how it can be applied to help the bored entity's scrolling through the internet and looking for a way to entertain thy-self. The projects that you shall find on this website are concepts designs and prototypes that I use to hone my development skills, and recreate the many project ideas that are floating in my mind. </p>

        <h1>Recent news:</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have begun to dabble in game development, and my first webgame <a class="a" href="https://viktorkorolyuk.github.io/SWipe/">"Swipe"</a> was released a while ago. The concept of the game is to match the color of a subject square to the direction of two parent squares containing two random colors. The game was slowly modified to speed up after every correct answer... in result the game speeds up to in-human speeds and even the bot that I had implemented into the game did not hold up to score level 8591.</p>
